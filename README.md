# FORMULATION-IN-VITRO-AND-IN-VIVO-EVALUATION
Solid inclusion complexes prepared by kneaded complex of CBS and HP-Î²-CD with soluplus
(1:1:1) was selected as the optimized ratio for the formulation of tablets and the ANN
predicted values for this formulation were in close agreement with the observed experimental
values. Tablets weighing 300 mg equivalent to 75 mg of CBS were prepared by direct
compression method. The ternary complex i.e., drug, cyclodextrin and soluplus polymer and
diluents were passed through sieve no #22 (approximate particle size is 0.71 mm). All the
above ingredients were properly mixed together in a polybag. Mannitol and magnesium
stearate were passed through sieve #60, mixed and blended with initial mixture in a polybag.
The powder blend was compressed into tablets by using a 16- station rotary tablet

compression machine on 9 mm flat faced punches. The weight of the tablet was kept constant
to 300mg.
